# How do I install Rio?

Rio is available on PyPI, so you can install it using pip:

```bash
pip install rio
```

On some platforms, `pip` isn't available directly in the command line. If you're
running into trouble with the command above, try one of theses alternatives:

```bash
python -m pip install rio
```

```bash
python3 -m pip install rio
```

```bash
py -m pip install rio
```
