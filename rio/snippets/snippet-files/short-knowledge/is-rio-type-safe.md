# Is Rio Type Safe?

Rio is built from the ground up to support modern Python features - including
type hints.  Virtually all functions have type hints, ensuring that linters work
well with your codebase. Visual Studio Code for example will automatically
detect many problems with your code, and thanks to the type hints there is very
few false positives.
