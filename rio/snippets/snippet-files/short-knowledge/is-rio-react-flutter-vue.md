# Is Rio just bindings to react / flutter / vue / a web framework?

At first blush, Rio can look really similar to other frameworks. That's because
Rio is built on the many good experiences and ideas from other frameworks, and
combines many of their best features into a single package. But Rio **is not
based on**, or share any source code with `react`, `flutter`, `vue`, or other
frameworks. It's built from the ground up and perfectly tailored to Python.
